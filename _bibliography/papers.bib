  abstract  = "Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and
               basic metabolic processes. The application of
               nitrogen-containing fertilizer increases yield, which has been a
               substantial factor in the green revolution1. Ecologically,
               however, excessive application of fertilizer has disastrous
               effects such as eutrophication2. A better understanding of how
               plants regulate nitrogen metabolism is critical to increase
               plant yield and reduce fertilizer overuse. Here we present a
               transcriptional regulatory network and twenty-one transcription
               factors that regulate the architecture of root and shoot systems
               in response to changes in nitrogen availability. Genetic
               perturbation of a subset of these transcription factors revealed
               coordinate transcriptional regulation of enzymes involved in
               nitrogen metabolism. Transcriptional regulators in the network
               are transcriptionally modified by feedback via genetic
               perturbation of nitrogen metabolism. The network, genes and
               gene-regulatory modules identified here will prove critical to
               increasing agricultural productivity.",
